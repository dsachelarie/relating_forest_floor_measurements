If this is not true, that it is likely that there is no correlation between those measurements. The second stronger assumption is that each cluster will correspond to measurements from just one plot. If this is not true, then it is likely that the measurements are completely independent of the plot they have been taken in, so there is probably no correlation to other measurements taken from the same plot.",
